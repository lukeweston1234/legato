/// A naive FIR filter implementation.

/// TODO: A ring buffer and per sample is convenient,
/// but this would likely have much better performance
/// if we rewrite this as a fixed size down the line, for
/// auto-vectorization, and maybe eventually
/// some SIMD/intrinsics.
///
/// My "dream DX", is something like a ringbuffer that we can use
/// in multiple places, that gives packed SIMD values,
/// and an optional remainder as well. Bonus points for doing
/// SIMD linear interp, hermite interp, etc.
///
/// We can probably easily use FMA operations here as well down the line,
/// but I will take a peak at this once the functionality is in place.
///
/// It's also worth noting that this operation in the
/// time domain is O(n * m).
///
/// This is only a good approach with small kernels,
/// for larger kernels, the operation is better in the frequency
/// domain, which we might implement later. But, doing FFT on the
/// input has a larger overhead until we reach fairly large kernel sizes.
///
/// If you have a kernel with 100+ taps, you should start considering
/// a frequency domain implementation, which we will hopefully get to soon!
///
/// However, for really large kernels i.e convolution hall reverb,
/// there is a bit of complixity with the overlapping and
/// partioning logic required. I would appreciate some help
/// designing a generalized solution for the above frequency domain
/// problem. From my understanding, its something along the lines
/// of splitting a long impulse response into a bunch of smaller power of 2
/// chunks, and having a spectral delay line that then synchronizes these.
///
/// For designing FIR filters, I have really been enjoying Numpy/SciPy.
/// When you use the UV manager suddeny I don't mind working with Python again.
